# Argon2-Password-Manager-With-GUI #
An improved version of my old CLI Argon2 password manager. Rewritten in C++ and using the Qt framework for the GUI.

## Tutorial ##
### Compilation ##
1) Make sure you have Argon2 and Qt installed on your system.
2) Change to the directory called "build": `cd build`
3) Run cmake: `cmake ..`
4) Run make: `make`

### The UI ###
The GUI is split into four sections:
1) Company search area.
2) Constraints file generation area.
3) Password generation area.
4) Logger area.
